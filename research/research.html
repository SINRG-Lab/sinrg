                <p class="project-description">
                This project focuses on advancing 3D content compression for Time-Varying Meshes (TVMs)‚Äîcomplex 3D objects and unbouded scenes with dynamic topology, vertex positions, and connectivity. TVMs are widely used in gaming, animation, augmented and virtual reality, but their high-quality visuals demand significant storage and transmission resources. We introduce TVMC project which explores novel compression algorithms for TVMs that leverages volume-tracked reference meshes to address the challenges of varying topology and inter-frame redundancies. Unlike existing methods (e.g., MPEG V-DMC), TVMC handles dynamic and self-contact scenarios effectively, reducing artifacts and distortions. Successful completion of this project enables applications for immersive experiences with more accessible, high-quality 3D content delivery over the Internet.

                <p class="project-description">
                    This project leverages advances in deep learning and computer vision to redefine video compression and content delivery, addressing the growing demands of high-resolution video formats like 4K/8K, mesh sequences, and point cloud videos. Traditional compression methods are not equipped to handle the bandwidth and quality challenges posed by the emerging XR applications, especially with dynamic user interactions such as 6-DoF movements. AI-powered solutions in this project focus on adaptive compression algorithms, precise Field of View prediction, and intelligent streaming strategies to deliver only the necessary data for a user‚Äôs predicted view. The ultimate goal is to create a scalable and efficient content delivery system that supports seamless, immersive, and high-quality experiences, even on devices with limited bandwidth capabilities.

                <p class="project-description">
                Tracking multiple agents, including humans and robots, in dynamic, everyday environments is a critical challenge for delivering reliable XR applications. Existing solutions rely heavily on visual tracking methods like SLAM and odometry, which are sensitive to environmental factors such as lighting and occlusions. This project addresses these limitations by augmenting visual tracking with RF-based positioning technologies, creating a complementary multi-modal tracking system. The focus is on improving accuracy, robustness in diverse conditions, and scalability across multiple agents while addressing key tasks such as object detection, association/registration, localization, and tracking. Additionally, the project explores advanced tracking functionalities like head and eye tracking for XR headsets.
